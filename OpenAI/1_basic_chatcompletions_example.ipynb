She is best known for her pioneering research on radioactivity, which led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry). Her groundbreaking work laid the foundation for many advancements in the field of nuclear physics and medicine. Curie's contributions to science and her perseverance in the face of gender discrimination have made her an inspirational figure for generations.\n"
