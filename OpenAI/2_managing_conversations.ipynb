    "To successfully manage a conversation with a GPT chat model, we want the model to be aware of the message history. However, since each model has a limit on the number of tokens it can process (and thereby the length of the message history), we need to make sure that we don't exceed this limit. To be able to do this, we use the `tiktoken` library to keep track of the number of tokens in the message history and remove the oldest messages when the limit is reached.\n",
    "The number of tokens that can be processed depends on the model used. For example, `gpt-3.5-turbo` can process up to 4097 tokens, while `gpt-4` is capable of processing up to 8192 tokens. A good rule of thumb is to keep the message history below 80% of the model's token limit, to allow for some flexibility in the length of the generated response. A complete overview of the token limits for each model can be found in the [OpenAI Models Overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4)."

      "[USER]: Who was Marie Curie?\n",
      "[ASSISTANT]: Marie Curie, born Maria Skłodowska, was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who became one of the most famous scientists in history. She is best known for her pioneering research on radioactivity, which led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry). Her groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern physics and greatly contributed to advancements in medical science. Curie's achievements and her determination to overcome gender barriers have made her an inspirational figure for generations of scientists.\n",
      "[USER]: Did she met Albert Einstein?\n",
      "[ASSISTANT]: Yes, Marie Curie did meet Albert Einstein. In 1911, Curie attended the first Solvay Conference in Brussels, which was a gathering of the world's leading physicists. Einstein was also present at the conference, and it is believed that they had discussions and interactions during the event. Both Curie and Einstein were highly respected scientists of their time, and their paths crossed on several occasions at scientific conferences and events. While there is no detailed record of their specific conversations, it is known that they held mutual admiration for each other's work.\n",
